Project 9: Play a Ringtone
==========================

This project extends on the work done in Project 7 (External Audio Device) by
extending the sample audio driver with an AVAudioPlayer controller, which will
play a short ringtone while waiting for the subscriber to connect to the client
device.

The main controller is mostly the same as the previous, with an immediate call
to set the audio device driver. In this sample, we add an additional call to our
new audio device driver to begin playing back an audio file that will act as 
a ringtone:

```
    NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"bananaphone"
                                                     ofType:@"mp3"];
    NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:path];
    [_myAudioDevice playRingtoneFromURL:url];
```

Additionally, once the device has connected to a subscriber stream, a call is
issued to stop playback of the ringtone:

```
- (void)subscriberDidConnectToStream:(OTSubscriberKit*)subscriber
{
    NSLog(@"subscriberDidConnectToStream (%@)",
          subscriber.stream.connection.connectionId);
    
    // Stop ringtone from playing, as the subscriber will connect shortly
    [_myAudioDevice stopRingtone];
    ...

```

Application Notes
-----------------

* There is no timeout for the audio player. If the asset plays to completion or
  there is an error, all calls from OTAudioBus will be passed to the audio
  driver, and playback/capture for OpenTok will proceed as normal.

* An additional tap gesture recognizer has been added to this sample to show
  and test that this sequence will work through multiple calls. The 
  `resetSession` method is added to implement this workflow.
