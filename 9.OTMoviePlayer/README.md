Project 9: Movie Player
==================================

This project shows how to use Opentok SDK to stream a mov file. It does this
by utilizing the extenral Audio and Video API's provided in the iOS SDK. The 
current implementation uses CoreAudio as a sudo timer. CA is setup to sample
from the microphone at the same sample rate as the demo video. For each 
recording callback audio is pulled from file or a circular buffer. It is then
passed into the iOS SDK. The time of each audio chunk is monitored and a video
image is passed into the SDK if the time of the video frame is equal to or less
than the time of the audio. In this way the video is 'slaved' to the audio. 

NOTE: This is currenly experimental.

Possible Uses
=============

- Inserting ads in a broadcast.
