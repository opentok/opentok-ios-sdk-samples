Basic Video Chat sample app
===========================

The Basic Video Chat app is a very simple application meant to get a new developer
started using the Vonage Client SDK Video iOS. 

Swift Package Manager
---------------------
In this example the Vonage Client SDK Video iOS was already included as a Swift Package Dependency.

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, you should select 
*File* > *Swift Packages* > *Add Package Dependency* and enter its repository URL,
in this case `https://github.com/opentok/vonage-client-sdk-video.git`.
